## 3. Sequence Diagrams for API Calls

ðŸ“„ [2. Sequence Diagrams for API Calls.mmd](2.%20Sequence%20Diagrams%20for%20API%20Calls%20.mmd)

ðŸ‘‰ This diagram shows how the application works when using an API:  
The interface (API or CLI) uses a facade to access functions, which then read or save data in files or a database.
